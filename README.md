# XnonBot

A general purpose discord bot developed by XnonXte, written in Python with py-cord. If you want to contribute in one way or another, you're more than welcome to join the [testing server]("https://discord.gg/hHYfnqa6zS"). For contact information, please refer to my GitHub page.

## Self-hosting

Pass your discord token inside the `bot.run()` function. If you want to have `/pexels` command working, you'd have to sign for a pexels api on their [developer page](https://www.pexels.com/api/) then pass the token once again inside the `pexels_client_api = API()` variable in `BotModules/xnonbot_requests`. Then, when you've had everything set up, launch `XnonBot.bat` for an easy startup.
